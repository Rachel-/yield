Yield
=====

##What is Yield?
Yield is a Project management application based on Redmine 2.6.0. 

##Why create Yield?
Our main goal is to rebuild the whole interface using Bootstrap elements. Additionally, we would like to add CRM functionality, Agile Project management elements and ultimately to enhance mobile experience in order to provide an easy to use online platform for businesses. 

##How can *YOU* help?
Since we are currently working on multiple projects, our time is limited. Therefore, your contribution will be much needed and appreciated, because this is a large scale project.
